# Covid19-Dashboard

This project was part of my graduate course, for which I had to reproduce the Covid19 Dashboard found [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjY1YzIyNTYtNzE3MS00M2EzLThjZDEtOTQzY2Q0ODg3ZjViIiwidCI6IjJiZGU2MmUwLTM2YjItNGJkOC1hZTRiLTg0ZTRlOWM0ZDMzOSJ9&amp;pageName=ReportSection8bc4c0915a0943633406). The data source is live and is obtained from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/01-14-2022.csv)

The dashboard can be traversed between pages with buttons in each page.

The first page serves an introduction page to the dashboard.

The second page gives a bit of information on Covid19

The third page shows different vizualizations from the dataset.
